To install all dependecies. You have to rrun this command line
```sh
pip install -r
```

To run the project you have to set up your database configuration in the file named `config.cfg`.

Then you have to run the app.py file whit this line of code

You have to install `python 3.6`.

You have to use a DBMS to run the database. I recomend Xampp or Workbench.

Import the database located at `Dise√±o folder`, the name is `movie.sql`

**Remember**
If you change your db credentials you have to change it in the `config.cfg` file.



To install dependencies. You have to run this command Line at the /src/ level

```sh
pip install -r
```
*This will run the `requirements.txt` file* 

To run the project you have to execute the `app.py` file
with


```sh
python app.py
```


Finally, you will run your flask server on the port: *5000*
